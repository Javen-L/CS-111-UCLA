lab1a.c: the C source code that performs Character-at-a-time, full duplex 
terminal I/O supporting a --shell argument that runs shell commands from
input

Makefile: includes 3 targets:
default - compiles lab1a.c to lab1a executable with -Wall, -Wextra, and -g
clean - removes created files, returns directory to state before running
	program
dist - creates tarball containing lab1a.c, this README, and Makefile
